      <h2>ADVANTAGES</h2>
      <p>
        1. CSS plays an important role, by using CSS you simply got to specify a
        repeated style for element once & use it multiple times as because CSS
        will automatically apply the required styles.<br />
        2. The main advantage of CSS is that style is applied consistently
        across variety of sites. One instruction can control several areas which
        is advantageous.<br />
        3. Web designers needs to use few lines of programming for every page
        improving site speed.<br />
        4. It is less complex therefore the effort are significantly reduced.<br />
        5. It helps to form spontaneous and consistent changes.<br />
        6. Easy for the user to customize the online page<br />
      </p>
      <h2>DISADVANTAGES</h2>
      <p>
        1. With CSS, what works with one browser might not always work with
        another. The web developers need to test for compatibility, running the
        program across multiple browsers.<br />
        2. There exists a scarcity of security.<br />
        3. CSS works differently on different browsers. IE and Opera supports
        CSS as different logic.<br />
